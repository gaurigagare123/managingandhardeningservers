The project aims to enhance the security and manageability of servers by implementing a comprehensive and automated solution for concurrent server hardening and management. Leveraging a combination of industry-standard tools and technologies such as CIS benchmarks, network hardening techniques, Terraform, Packer, AWS Inspector, Git, and Jenkins, the project seeks to ensure that all servers meet rigorous security standards while maintaining operational efficiency. Terraform and Packer are used for automated provisioning and configuration management, while AWS Inspector performs continuous security assessments. Git and Jenkins facilitate version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for seamless updates and deployments. This integrated approach enables the team to harden multiple servers simultaneously, ensuring compliance with best practices and reducing the risk of security breaches.
